# FRA361_Open_Topic – Physical Aimbot

Physical Aimbot prototype for FRA361 – combines YOLO-based computer vision with a mecanum-wheel mouse-robot (ESP32 + Python).

This repository contains all source code, CAD files, dataset scripts, and documentation for my FRA361 Open Topic project:

* **Goal** – build a *physical* aimbot that moves a real mouse to targets in Kovaak/FPS scenarios by combining  
  * YOLOv5 object-detection (Python, PyTorch)  
  * an ESP32-controlled, mecanum-wheel robot base  
  * inverse-kinematics motor control + Bluetooth HID click
